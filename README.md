# Monica Patel — Unity Game Developer Portfolio

This repository powers my interactive portfolio, a space where I share my journey as a Unity developer, the studios I have collaborated with, and the games and tools I continue to build. The site couples cinematic 3D canvases with clean storytelling so recruiters, collaborators, and fellow developers can explore my work quickly.

- Experienced in leading builds from prototype through launch while mentoring junior developers and partnering with art, design, and backend teams.
- Comfortable weaving multiplayer services, SDK integrations, and platform-specific polish into fast-moving production cycles.
